# Daily Algorithms for the web fundamentals stack

Week 1 is labelled awkwardly because the algorithms started on Tuesday. So Tuesday is w1d1 and so on.

Weeks 2 and 3 do not have that problem and w2d1 is that Monday's algorithms.

I often tweak and play with the algorithms before or after class, so they most recent commit may not be the exact same as what was typed during the group meeting.
