// Last Digit of A to the B
// Modern computers can handle very large numbers, but this ability has limits. If a number is repeatedly
// multiplied by itself, it eventually exceeds the computerâ€™s ability to accurately represent it. (Side note: the
// number of times it is multiplied by itself is called the exponent .) For an optional end-of-chapter
// challenge, determine the smallest (least significant) digit of a number that is potentially very, very large.
// You may find that you must do this without computing the actual (unimaginably large) number.
// Implement a function that accepts two non-negative integers as arguments. Function lastDigitAtoB(a,
// b) should return the last digit of the first number (a) raised to an exponent of the second number (b).
// Examples: given (3, 4) , you should return 1 (the last digit of 81: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3). Given (12, 5) , return
// 2 (the least significant digit of 248832, which is 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 * 12).

function lastDigitAtoB(a, b) {
  a = a % 10;
  return a ** b % 10;
}
console.log(lastDigitAtoB(3, 4));
console.log(lastDigitAtoB(12, 5));
